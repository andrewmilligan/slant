[[[ An embedded C program to control 2-axis solar trackers autonomously. ]]]


At [Solaflect Energy][solaflect] I proactively took over development of the
proprietary tracker controller code base. We manufactured, sold, and installed
pole-mounted 2-axis solar trackers that had to work autonomously in rural
Vermont and New Hampshire without a reliable internet connection. Before I took
control of the code base, Solaflect's control system was an embedded C program 
that had been hastily written by a consultant shortly after the creation of the
company. Six years later, I brought it back into active development.

My improvements included making the controls system autonomous and not
constantly reliant on external inputs and converting the controls system into a
state machine that was more reliable and robust.
