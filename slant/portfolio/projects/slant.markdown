[[[ The front page and custom CMS of Slanted Labs, an independent project
working to illuminate American socioeconomic inequality with data. ]]]


The [Slant][1] is an independent web project working to illuminate
socioeconomic inequality with data. I built its entire web infrastructure from
scratch. Built on a simple Django web application, the front page of Slanted
Labs uses a custom content management system (CMS) to publish data-driven
articles. I built a set of shortcodes to embed custom blocks of HTML in
articles, making it easy to add graphs, images, and more.
