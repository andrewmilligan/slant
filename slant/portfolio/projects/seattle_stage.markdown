Seattle Stage was a project envisioned by the [Frozen Sea Theatre
Collective][1], a group of theatre artists striving to create a place for new
works and female driven work in the Seattle Area. Their mission is "to break
the ice to the frozen sea in all of us through meaningful and powerful
theatre", and they seek to achieve this both by writing and producing
challenging and empowering shows, and by connecting and engaging the Seattle
theatre community as a whole. Part of their effort to engage the broader
community is the Seattle Stage project, a web application to collate and
promote theatre productions in Seattle.

As of now, Seattle Stage has not been brought fully online, but we hope to
release it soon.
