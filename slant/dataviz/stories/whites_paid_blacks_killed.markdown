[[[ Both income and police killings are distributed unequally along racial
lines. Between 2013 and 2015, white people's share of income was greater than
their share of population; between 2013 and 2017, black people's share of
police killings was greater than their share of population. ]]]


In recent years, both income and police killings have been distributed
unequally along racial lines: white people get paid while black people get
killed by law enforcement agencies. Relative to their respective shares of
state populations, white people were paid a disproportionately high amount of
family income from 2013 to 2015 according to census data from [IPUMS][ipums],
while black people made up a disproportionately high number of police killing
victims between 2013 and 2017 according to data from [Mapping Police
Violence][mpv].

To measure income disparity, I collected census data from IPUMS for the years
2013, 2014, and 2015 that included family total income grouped by race and
state. The racial disparity in these data is shown in the figure below. In 49
states and the District of Columbia, white people received a larger percentage
of family income than they represent demographically (the exception is Hawaii).
The disparity between the percentage of income white people receive and the
percentage of white people in the population is, in the average state, 5
points. It ranges up to 20 points, with white people, who make up 40% of the DC
population, taking home 60% of the income.

Black people tend to receive a correspondingly low percentage of income. In DC,
black people make up roughly 48% of the population, but receive only 30% of the
income.

    family income, race, and state from 2013 to 2015. Get the data and code

}

The map below shows the geographical distribution of the disparity between the
white population and income received by white people. DC clearly stands out as
having the highest disparity by far, but most of the southern states also rank
amongst the worst. The entire band of states from South Carolina to Louisiana
fall in the top six worst states. The New York tri-state area also suffers from
high disparities.

White people are over-represented in income, but black people are even more
over-represented as victims of police killings. According to [Mapping Police
Violence][mpv], over 5400 people have been killed by police in the U.S. since
2013. Black people are three times as likely as whites to be among these
victims. They also found that some of the largest U.S. city police departments
"kill black men at higher rates than the U.S. murder rate".

The graph below shows the disparity in each state between the percentage of
police killing victims who are black and the percentage of the population that
is black. In 42 states and DC, black people are over-represented in victims of
police killings. The disparity between the percentage of police killing victims
who are black and the percentage of the population that is black is, on
average, 16 points. DC again stands out with a disparity of 45 points. Roughly
50% of DC's population is black, but a startling 95% of people killed by police
in DC between 2013 and 2017 were black.

  footnote = "Data from [Mapping Police
    Violence](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/), who constructed a database
    of police killings from 2013 to the present. Get the data and code used
    [here](https://github.com/slantedlabs/whites_paid_blacks_killed)."
}

The map below shows the disparity between black people demographically and
black people killed by police. Again, DC stands out, but the Midwest also
stands out as being particularly bad. Illinois has the second highest
disparity: black people only make up 15% of the Illinois population, but 53% of
the people killed by police in Illinois between 2013 and 2017 were black.
Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Ohio are all in the top quartile. The New
York tri-state area, again, ranks among the states with the highest
disparities.

All of this suggests a continuing and very real pattern of systematic racial
oppression. Socioeconomic oppression of black communities that has been going
on for the entire history of this country and continues today cripples those
communities. Racism takes on many forms from the explicit, as [seen
recently][charlottesville] in Charlottesville, to the subtle, as demonstrated
in a [recent report][marshallproj] from the Marshall Project on the systematic
justification of homicides in which white people kill black men. Such ingrained
racism, combined with socioeconomic oppression, contributes directly to the
continuation of direct physical violence against black communities by law
enforcement agencies in a very real way. Real and concrete steps must be taken
to actively correct these patterns in order to create a just and equal society.
