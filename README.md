# The Slant

The Slant is an independent web project working to illuminate socioeconomic
inequality with data. I built its entire web infrastructure from scratch. Built
on a simple Django web application, the front page of Slanted Labs uses
a custom content management system (CMS) to publish data-driven articles.
I built a set of shortcodes to embed custom blocks of HTML in articles, making
it easy to add graphs, images, and more.
